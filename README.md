Pickup is for all people who want to play basketball in Vancouver and it helps connect people who enjoy the sport. Our project will store player profiles, matches (like Tinder), pickup games location and times, and chat messages. Users will be able to edit their profile, match with other people and find basketball games. We hope to allow users to filter profiles for beginners and gender. It would be nice to track how busy places are and show a map of where there are basketball courts.

*  Project task requirements:
   * 3-5 minimal requirements (will definitely complete)

   * 2-3 stretch requirements (plan to complete at least 1!)

Create teams
*  Pick 2 of your minimal requirements and break each of them down into ~2-5 smaller tasks!
